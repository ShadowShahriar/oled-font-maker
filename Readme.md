# oled-font-maker

This tool was inspired by the original [**OLED-js Font Foundry**](https://noopkat.github.io/oled-js-font-foundry/) created by [**Suz Hinton**](https://github.com/noopkat) for [**oled-js**](https://github.com/noopkat/oled-js). However, **oled-js** no longer compatible with the **Raspberry Pi 5**. So, I had to use migrate to one of its supported forks [`oled-rpi-i2c-bus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oled-rpi-i2c-bus).

This new package does not offer a tool for creating custom font modules, so I developed my own.
